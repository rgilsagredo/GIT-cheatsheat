# My GIT Cheatsheet


## Starting a project
You can either start a project locally on your computer *or* you can clone a repo from a server (GitHub or similar).

### Local
To create a local project, go to the folder with the console and type **git init**. And that's it. But you'll like to have something remote to save your local changes.
So create an empty repo in GitHub or similar and do a **git remote add origin _url_to_the_repo_**. After this, you want to "sync" them, use 
**git push -u origin master** so master branch in your local computer tracks master branch in remote repo. The points of this are several, 
but basically makes your life easier.

### Clone from remote

## Managing files

## Branching

## Rebasing
